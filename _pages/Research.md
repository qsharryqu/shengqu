"College Admission, Mismatch, and Labor Market Outcomes"

This paper estimates the effects of the Chinese college admission reform on the labor market outcomes of students, where changes were made to reduce the mismatch between student ability and college quality in 26 out of 34 provinces in China. Using an individual-level dataset that contains detailed information on students' labor market behavior, this study shows that the college admission reform had no impact on the log yearly labor income of affected students.
